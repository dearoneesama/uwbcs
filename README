My digital notes for CS courses taken in class at University of Waterloo. They are hosted on [this website](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y3285wan/).

## Workflow
Notes taken in class serve as a condensed version of the course material (coursenotes, slides, etc.), which can be used for homework and test preparation.

Steps to write the notes:
1. Edit markdown files during each lecture;
2. At the end of each week, create/update tables of contents, and using any supported VS Code extension, export the markdown files to HTML;
3. Copy the build files to the `public_html` of your CS student server:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x
TARGET=<username>@linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca
SSH_KEY=<key path>
FILES=''
FILENAME="tmp_scp_cpy$(date +$Y%m%d-%H%M%S).zip"

for course in cs444 cs452
do
    FILES+=' '${course}'/note.html '${course}'/assets'
done

# zip build files to a temp file
zip -r $FILENAME $FILES
# copy the zip to the server
scp -i $SSH_KEY -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null $FILENAME $TARGET:~/public_html
# unzip & remove the file on the server, and change permissions of the build files
ssh -i $SSH_KEY -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null $TARGET "cd public_html && unzip -o \"${FILENAME}\" && rm \"${FILENAME}\" && chmod -R 755 ."
# remove the zip file locally
rm $FILENAME
```

## Techniques
* If required, take screenshots of the course slides or the professor's drawing and embed them in the markdown file. On Windows one can uses the snipping tool (Win-sn-Enter). Beware of the letter cases;
* If diagrams are easy to reproduce in pixels, use [asciiflow](https://github.com/lewish/asciiflow) and paste the ASCII art as a code block;
* FSM can be drawn using [this](https://madebyevan.com/fsm/);
* To type special characters in non-latex mode, first type it in latex (`$\epsilon$`), then copy the rendered character;
* Giant markdown source file can slow down the editor. Cut the existing contents into other files before the lecture and paste them back after the lecture;
